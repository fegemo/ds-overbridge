  <p>The data used to create this visualization.</p>

  <h2 id="data-about-the-movies-characters-etc-">Data about the movies (characters etc.)</h2>
  <p>The data regarding the movies info was grabbed from the <a href="http://swapi.co/">Star Wars API</a>
  project. It does not provide full files for each entity, so I made a lot of
  requests to fetch all of them and then assembled the responses in the files:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><code>planets.json</code> (61 <a href="http://swapi.co/api/planets/">planets</a>)</li>
  <li><code>people.json</code> (87 <a href="http://swapi.co/api/people/">people</a>)</li>
  <li><code>species.json</code> (37 <a href="http://swapi.co/api/species/">species</a>)</li>
  <li><code>starships.json</code> (37 <a href="http://swapi.co/api/starships/">starships</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The API has even more data, about the movies (7 so far) and vehicles (39), but
  they were not used here.</p>
  <h2 id="data-about-the-galaxy-its-geography-">Data about the galaxy (its geography)</h2>
  <p>The geographic data was acquired from the <a href="http://www.swgalaxymap.com/">Star Wars Galaxy Map</a> and
  comprises 5 sets of topography in the <em>geojson</em> format, which became layers
  on the map: grid, planets, <del>hyperspace</del> (not used), region, sector.</p>
  <p>To reduce its size, the geographic data was simplified using
  <a href="http://mapshaper.org/">mapshaper</a> using the Visvalingam method with weighted area. That
  yielded 44% size reduction with only a small perceived loss.</p>
  <p>Regarding planets, the <a href="http://www.swgalaxymap.com/">Star Wars Galaxy Map</a> has about 2,068 planets
  with their coordinates, comprising all of canon and &quot;extended universe&quot;
  locations. However, as the movies database had information about only 61
  (canon) planets, only those were considered.</p>
  <h2 id="joining-the-data">Joining the data</h2>
  <p>Only planets that exist both on the geographic database and on the movies
  database were considered. To join their data, two fields called <code>&quot;name&quot;</code>
  and <code>&quot;name_web&quot;</code> from the <em>planets layer</em> from the geography database were
  tentatively matched with a field called <code>&quot;name&quot;</code> on the <code>planets.json</code> from
  the movies database.</p>

  <h2 id="about">About</h2>
  <p>What if the <strong>3rd Death Star</strong> was actually constructed? Wear <strong>Lord Vader&#39;s</strong>
  boots and decide, from its control room (<strong>the Overbridge</strong>), <strong>which planets
  to destroy</strong> with the death ray next. To aid in the decision, the
  Overbridge allows the visualization of:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>The <strong>galaxy</strong>, its regions, sectors and most notable <strong>planets</strong></li>
  <li>What are the <strong>climates and terrain types</strong> of the <strong>selected planets</strong><ul>
  <li>Allows understanding what sort of troops to send down, if necessary</li>
  <li>Allows seeing which types of climates/terrains might cease existing if
  the selected planets are indeed destroyed</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are the <strong>languages spoken</strong> on those planets and the <strong>number of
  individuals</strong> on the selected planets speaking each one</li>
  <li>Some <strong>watched individuals</strong> that might have their home planets (and lives)
  destroyed by the next move, <strong>grouped by their species</strong> and
  <strong>color-coded by gender</strong></li>
  <li>The <strong>types of starships</strong> those watched individuals know how to pilot<ul>
  <li>Some starships might become useless if all of its pilots are lost</li>

    <p>This project, the Star Wars Galaxy Visualization depends on data provided by two other projects, as described below.</p>
  </header>
  <div class="modal-content">
    <h2 id="movies-data">Movies Data</h2>
    <p>The planets, movies, people, species and all non-geographic data
      used by this project comes from the SWAPI - the <a href="https://swapi.co/">Star Wars API</a>,
      made and maintained by <a href="http://phalt.co/">Paul Hallet</a>. The SWAPI is licensed under
      a BSD license.
    </p>
    <p>Paul Hallet built and maintains SWAPI by himself and needs support with
      its costs. If you like this or his project, please <a href="https://swapi.co/">consider donating</a>
      for him to keep the API working forever, as it is a great resource
      for learning about Web/AJAX/APIs etc., while also holding precious data.
    </p>
    <h2 id="map-data">Map Data</h2>
    <p>The map data was generated by the awesome work from <a href="http://www.swgalaxymap.com/">Henry Bernberg</a>
      @ <a href="https://hbernberg.carto.com/me">Carto</a> and fetched as GeoJSON files describing separate layers
      of his <a href="https://hbernberg.carto.com/viz/76e286d4-fbab-11e3-b014-0e73339ffa50/public_map">Galaxy Map</a>.
