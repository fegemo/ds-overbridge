# Attribution

This project, the Star Wars Galaxy Visualization depends on data provided by two other projects, as described below.

## Movies Data

The planets, movies, people, species and all non-geographic data
used by this project comes from the SWAPI - the [Star Wars API][swapi],
made and maintained by [Paul Hallet][paul]. The SWAPI is licensed under
a BSD license.

Paul Hallet built and maintains SWAPI by himself and needs support with
its costs. If you like this or his project, please [consider donating][swapi]
for him to keep the API working forever, as it is a great resource
for learning about Web/AJAX/APIs etc., while also holding precious data.


## Map Data

The map data was generated by the awesome work from [Henry Bernberg][henry]
@ [Carto][carto] and fetched as GeoJSON files describing separate layers
of his [Galaxy Map][galaxy-map].

- Map:
  - [Galaxy Map][galaxy-map]
- Geographic datasets:
  - [Planets][planets]
  - [Sector][sector]
  - [Hyperspace][hyperspace]
  - [Region][region]
  - [Grid][grid]

This project is built on top of Henry Bernberg's work and he needs to maintain
it running so, if you like this or his project, please consider donating to
him on [his page][henry].
