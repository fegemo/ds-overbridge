## About

What if the **3rd Death Star** was actually constructed? Wear **Lord Vader's**
boots and decide, from its control room (**the Overbridge**), **which planets
to destroy** with the death ray next. To aid in the decision, the
Overbridge allows the visualization of:

1. The **galaxy**, its regions, sectors and most notable **planets**
1. What are the **climates and terrain types** of the **selected planets**
   - Allows understanding what sort of troops to send down, if necessary
   - Allows seeing which types of climates/terrains might cease existing if
     the selected planets are indeed destroyed
1. What are the **languages spoken** on those planets and the **number of
   individuals** on the selected planets speaking each one
1. Some **watched individuals** that might have their home planets (and lives)
   destroyed by the next move, **grouped by their species** and
   **color-coded by gender**
1. The **types of starships** those watched individuals know how to pilot
   - Some starships might become useless if all of its pilots are lost
